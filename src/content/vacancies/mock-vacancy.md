Our greatest challenge is in building the great team that will enable our mission and that starts with our people, regardless of their background.

# Working Culture

At Chassis Autonomy, we embrace the flexible working; however, we also recognise that there no better way to solve complex engineering problems than gathering around physical test hardware or grouping around a white board to brainstorm solutions. The next two to three years at Chassis Autonomy will be focused upon intensive R&D and this will require extensive in-person collaboration across the company.

Furthermore, to lay the foundations for a positive and inclusive culture at Chassis Autonomy, in-person attendance will be required to build relationships across departments and to welcome and integrate new staff into the wider team. You must therefore be committed to attending our offices as required by the project or programme you are working on, and to support wider business activities. At other times, flexible working is very much supported.

The wider Chassis Autonomy group is split between our base in Trollhättan, Sweden and our base in the UK. As we scale operations in both countries, there will be opportunities and in some cases requirements to travel between the two locations, in addition to travel within the EU and the rest of the world to support development programmes with our customers.
