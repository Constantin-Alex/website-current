Chassis Autonomy has been awarded consortium project funding from Innovate UK through the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles in the CAM (Connected and Automated Mobility) Supply Chain Competition. The £1.7m project has been awarded £1.2m of funding to support the development and demonstration of a fully redundant fail-operational SAE Level 4 autonomous vehicle platform. The project is named SAFE (Systems for Autonomy in Fail-operational Environments) and it brings together technology leaders within the industry to demonstrate the full capabilities of autonomous vehicles.

The autonomous vehicle platform will be delivered by: StreetDrone, Alcon Components, the University of Surrey (UoS) and Chassis Autonomy. By integrating purpose-built fail-operational systems and other technologies from across the industry, the project is an important collaboration for the advancement of safe autonomous mobility in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

The SAFE project brings the widespread commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles one step closer. It will benefit from the following contributions: fail-operational platform, autonomous driving software stack, and vehicle integration from StreetDrone; fail-operational brake-by-wire system from Alcon Components, a dissemination film and steer-by-wire simulation test rig from the UoS, and a fail-operational steer-by-wire system from Chassis Autonomy.

Chassis Autonomy will build upon their previous collaboration with the UoS, to develop a sophisticated HiL (hardware-in-the-loop) test rig for the validation of the SbW system in this vehicle application. The UoS will also create a range of high quality marketing materials to ensure the project objectives and outcomes are widely disseminated, to the benefit of the project and the wider autonomous sector.

The autonomous vehicle platform will apply the ground-breaking fail-operational steer-by-wire system developed by Chassis Autonomy, in tandem with the brake-by-wire system developed by Alcon. Together, these systems solve a critical market issue, ensuring steering and braking functionality and thus safety, even in the event of a system or vehicle fault.

Head of Software Engineering and Control Electronics at Chassis Autonomy, Bogdan Racotea said, “The chance to co-develop a true L4 autonomous vehicle platform is very exciting. As a leading disruptor and innovator in the highly automated and fully autonomous space, this is a great opportunity to deploy our technology alongside the exceptional supply chain partners to demonstrate safe and reliable autonomy.”
